#### Press Release - For Immediate Release 

# Alleged Involvement of North American University Programs in Genocides 
**( Online resource, GitHub; 06 March 2023, 07:50 GMT)**

In an electronic communication provided to multiple Canadian consulates and to their counterparts, an author by the name of Sameer A. Khan, has alleged that various university programs in North America have continuously contributed to genocides. The allegations state that a range of genocidal activities with the involvement of universities, have been ongoing since decades, in the Americas, the Middle-East, and in parts of the African content, where US-led groups have had an involvement in military or security operations.  

The range of harmful activities conducted by US-led groups, and the various kinds of negative impacts suffered by victims as well as survivors, in multiple regions of the world, have been outlined by the author, in a series of articles published to an online website called "GitHub."  

The first set of those articles were [disclosed here](https://github.com/true-hindsight/grim-realities#blowing-the-whistle-on-canadas-ongoing-crimes-against-humanity-and-marginalised-groups), and are supposedly at the scale of tens of millions of Euros in fines, penalties, and remedies owed by a Canadian university, the University of Waterloo (UWaterloo), to current and previous students from various countries, of its program called "Masters of Business, Entrepreneurship, and Technology" (MBET). The reason being: the ineffective, inauthentic, and injurious nature of MBET, especially for profiled and targeted international students from countries labeled as "emerging economies."  

The first set of articles also allege that multiple Designated Learning Institutes (DLIs) of Canada, as well as the government body called Universities Canada, have conducted an international-scale Ponzi scheme to pay-off investors of startups incubated in universities, through programs like MBET; and have willfully colluded with Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship, Canada (IRCC) to harm international students. 

[The collusion between DLIs and IRCC](https://github.com/true-hindsight/grim-realities/blob/main/intro-to-special-report-2022-11-11-1.md#6-introduction-to-special-report-2022-11-11-1) is reported to have been ongoing since the creation of immigration policies related to DLIs. The harms produced from reported systemic malfeasance via IRCC, continue to be caused by hidden briers, erected by colluding agencies against international students and workers from particular countries. Barriers hidden within IRCC immigration policies and procedures are reported to have been deliberately designed, and implemented, for depriving targeted individuals and communities of socio-economic well being, appropriate legal statuses, and legitimate work opportunities within Canada â€” in a discriminatory manner. This compounding issue appears to be on the scale and order of hundreds of millions of Euros in unpaid restitution and reparations, owed by Canada to citizens of multiple countries, should these allegations be proven as warranted and truthful.  

The second set, [provided here](https://github.com/true-hindsight/long-overdue-justice#long-overdue-justice), are about issues that are on the scale of billions of Euros in royalties, remedies, and punitive damages owed by North American organizations to persons from multiple countries whose intellectual properties (IP) were misappropriated, via remorseless malpractices conducted within collages and universities of America, and Canada. Worse, those stolen and misappropriated materials and IP, have been continuously incorporated into acts of targeted mass civilian killings using automated defense systems like drones, by US-led forces. Worst of all, those illegitimately obtained defense systems are still being used by US-led organizations, and are even being sold to countries like Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates (UAE). 

These articles also point out that the reparations owed to victims and survivors, of illegal killings and wrongdoings committed by certain US-led organizations and North American entities, are entirely tractable, because the overall question of "unpaid reparations," is not something that is impossible to answer, as it can be factored into its manageable components to yield timely solutions and remedies. 

>Furthermore, the remedies and reparations that are to be paid out by North American entities in a timely manner, to international victims and survivors, will need to be evaluated in a suitable currency, such as Euros (EUR), Swiss Franc (CHF), or Renminbi (CNY). This is because currencies like the Canadian dollar (CAD) and the US dollar (USD), are respectively, the same as the asset reserve called Luna cryptocurrency, and the blockchain known as Terra. That is, CAD has always behaved the same as Luna, and USD has always, in and of itself, been the same as [Terra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(blockchain)#Collapse). Evaluating USD against any basket of currencies that includes CAD is problematic because the US government through its Federal Reserve and private contractors, can directly influence and manipulate, the daily exchange rates of CAD measured against other monetary values of assets traded within the global economy. The value of USD is conveniently rigged in this manner, when it is evaluated against a currency like CAD that is inseparably [autocorrelated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation) with USD; wherein, the true value of CAD within the international arena is never allowed to reach its independent potential by US-led groups of market manipulators.      

Sameer, the author and systems engineer, whose background and whereabouts aren't particularly well known at this time, says that these sets of documents revealed to the public are only the beginning. And when asked, why has he been working on producing such compositions, he says, "Though it might be considerably difficult to immediately recover a level of peace after exceeding maximum tilt, it is entirely impossible to 'uncut' a ribbon."  

As cryptic and peculiar as the above statement may sound, it is arguable that these matters and issues ought to be brought to the attention of a few delegates attending this year's G20 meetings being hosted in India.
