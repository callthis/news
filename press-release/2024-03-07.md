## A Briefing on Canadian State-Sponsored Violence Being Orchestrated Against International Students and Workers

When law enforcement agencies need to keep tabs on a "suspect" within North America, particularly one who has been characterized as a potentially "violent" assailant or a terrorist by local authorities, the chore of tracking that person's whereabouts and activities across borders of American states and Canadian provinces, is usually handled by homeland security agencies like the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). If or when the suspect exits Canadian and US territories, the task of tracking and investigating that person within international jurisdictions, is given to joint task force agencies, agencies that do not do investigations within national borders of the US, so as not to step on the toes of the FBI. But, when those international investigative agencies realize that the fault and culpability instead happens to be with the local agents or law enforcement officers who framed the so-called suspect, those internationally centralized agents tend to use passive and proxy methods of "cleaning up" the mess, created by their local counterparts. 

Rectifying the faults of, and reprimanding bad cops and public service units within the US and Canada, doesn't seem to be the mandate of those international task groups; so they instead find ways to give hints to characters like me who mysteriously seem, rather responsive. I however, believe that those centralized international agents are merely curious to see what will actually happen, if they keep furnishing a person like myself with information about the names of officers, of Justices of the Peace, and about database manipulations by employees within organizations like the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA); as all of those local entities colluded to frame me as a terror suspect, so as to harm me with murderous and genocidal intent, after cunningly having me thrown into a substitute jail in May-2020. Perhaps, those international agents are just annoyed that they are repeatedly made to chase after false suspects, by incompetent or bigoted bad-actors within cadres of American and Canadian nationalized law enforcement and social services systems. 

Perhaps, those international law enforcement agents know that someone like me will simply not rest until the wrongful officers and their supervisors within local units like the Waterloo Regional Police Services (WRPS), are put away in prison; merely demoting them, or suspending them for a few months, only to cover up their serial acts of felonies and coordinated genocidal activities, isn't going to cut it. The inter-generational and genocidal harms done to my diaspora by coordinated bad-faith actors employed by the leadership of those localized public service systems, has been continuous and ongoing since decades. Those systematic, deliberate, and targeted acts of violence committed by seemingly august groups of individuals within institutes like the University of Waterloo (UWaterloo), have allowed the corrupt leaders and managers of those bad-actors to profit financially, from supplying coordination and communication tools like HealthIM software to trained as well as instructed, hostile operatives employed within public service agencies like the CMHA, and the Grand River Hospitals and Clinics (GRHC). 

The breach of trust and confidentiality, and violations of duty of care, committed by members of those local groups and public institutes from Canada, is only the first set of violations within the chain of large-scale statutory crimes being committed by those state-sponsored agents. The punitive actions to reprimand them, along with the proper measures to permanently end their reign of malpractices and violence against vulnerable people, especially against visible minorities and international students and workers, needs to be implemented sincerely, without any further delays or hesitations.
